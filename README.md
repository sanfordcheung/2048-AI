# 2048-AI

2048-AI implements expectimax algorithm. It uses a efficient data structure to represent the game board and facilitate game operations. A great deal of work on game heuristics has improved the AI significantly. Current version of AI will make it to 8192 tile in my 70% trials. Running the program on my own PC, it takes one minute or two to finish a game.

Further improvement can be adjusting parameters in a machine learning approach, rather than hard coding all of them. It is not trivial for human to explore how to acheive pretty high score, for example, merging a 16384 tile. Hopefully, a more advanced AI may figure out the pattern.
